#### Identity problem/s the App will solve 

1.	Fortune telling for life guidance 
Many people look for guidance to lifes’ problems through fortune telling. Whether they accept the answers or fortunes they receive, or they use it as a measure to test how they feel about a topic; They do this by receiving the fortune or answer and reflecting on their reaction to that information to test how they feel about the area of life they are unsure about. This App provides a free fortune telling service where users can ask a specific yes or no question or ask for a broad message. 
####

2.	Fortune telling for entertainment purposes or Group Game users 
Truth or dare and similar group games are really popular, particularly among teenagers and young adults. This game provides a fun way to determine if a member of the group should complete the dare or answer the truth – by using the Oracle’s ‘yes or no question’ function to decide. Additionally, a lot of people use fortune telling for entertainment purposes 

#### Target Audience 
The target audience is split into those people seriously using the information received as guidance and those that use it as a game alone or with friends. Those that use this as a game are easier to determine as a demographic – they will mainly be teenagers or young adults. However, people seeking fortune telling for life guidance or entertainment purposes are a very broad demographic spanning all ages and spending in the US alone $2.2 billion a year (IBIS, 2019). 


#### User interaction

###### Game users
* Those that use it as a game might do so by coming up with group questions and using the game to determine the answer. For example, the group might do dares and say “Should Fiona cut a fringe in her hair” and then using the App's 'yes or no question' function to determine whether the dare should be done or left.   

###### Life guidance users
* Users seeking life guidance can use the App in different ways. Users may have a specific question in mind that they want to seek guidance on, in which case they can use the 'yes or no question function' and type in a 'yes or no' question for the oracle. The oracle will 'think' about the question which is displayed by the flashing message 'the oracle is thinking' and then it will respond with an answer from the list of answers = ["yes", "no", "maybe", "can't be sure right now", "time will tell"]. Users also have the option to not share their question but still seek an answer by pressing 'enter' twice when prompted for their question. 
* Users can also choose the option to ask for a mystery oracle reading. This option will present the user with a message not based on a question they have asked for.
