# TerminalApp
Fortune telling game as a Ruby Terminal App

## Statement of purpose and scope 
- A fortune telling game that is run from the terminal 

## Features List - MVP 
- As a user, I want to be able to ask a specific question and receive an answer on the scale of 'yes' to 'no'
- As a user, I want to be able to not have a specific question and just ask the oracle for a quick fortune without providing any information about myself
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to ask for psychic guidance about a broad topic in my life 

## Features List - nice to haves 
- As a user, I want to see colourful text and a mystical aesthetic to connect to the App

## User experience details 
- The App gives clear instructions to the user 
- The App feels like it has a oracle thinking through the questions 
- The App handles errors gracefully, and gives error messages that interpret the error as divinely created
